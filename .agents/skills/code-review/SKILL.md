# Code Review Guidelines

## Next.js RSC → Client Component Serialization

**Do NOT flag `Date` objects passed as props from Server Components to Client Components as a serialization bug.**

React's RSC wire format (used by Next.js App Router) natively supports `Date` objects and reconstructs them as proper `Date` instances on the client.

A real serialization concern only applies when data crosses a plain JSON boundary (e.g., a REST API response parsed with `JSON.parse`, `localStorage`, or `URLSearchParams`).
