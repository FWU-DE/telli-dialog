# e2e

This repository contains e2e tests that are integrated into the pipeline and run on every pull request and push to `main`.

For e2e tests we use [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) as this is currently the most non flaky way to do e2e tests.

For more information see [e2e/readme.md](../e2e/readme.md)
